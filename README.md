A project with the intention of making Fiesta Online playable with a controller.

Install all requirements in the requirements.txt file.
You need to upload the included sketch to an Arduino (Micro has been tested) and connect it to the computer.
Then run the Python Script.
Then you can plug in the controller to the computer.

You can then start playing with teh controller.

Note that this is only tested on Windows and with a Xboxone controller.
